# readme-generator

## Description

This is a professional README generator that generates a .md file, populated with responses from the user. This project was the result of learning the basics of node.js and the inquirer package. Undertaking this project helped reinforce what was learnt in class.

## Installation

No installation necessary. Please use your chosen terminal to open the repo directory and run the command "node index.js" to start the generator. Below is a video showing how the generator works:

## Credits

For the badges, I made use of Lukas Himsel's gist. He was kind enough to provide several pre-generated badges for licenses, of which I used the MIT, Apache, and CC 4.0 badges.

In addition to the following link, the class sessions held by the edX front-end bootcamp team have been invaluable for this challenge, especially in my understanding of template literals and utilising packages.
